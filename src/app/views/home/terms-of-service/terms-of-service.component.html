                    <p><strong>Stage 1: Mediation.</strong>&nbsp;In case of a dispute, the matter will first be attempted to be resolved by a sole mediator who is a neutral third party and will be selected at the mutual acceptance of a proposed mediator
                        by both parties. Both parties may raise a name for the sole mediator and in the case both parties accept the proposed name, the said person shall be appointed as sole mediator. In case the parties are not able to reach a consensus
                        within two proposed mediators, the Company reserves the right to decide who the final mediator is. The decision of the mediator is not binding on both parties.</p>
                    <p><strong>Stage 2: Arbitration.</strong>&nbsp;In case that mediation does not yield a result suitable or preferred by any one of the parties, arbitration may follow, the award of which is binding on both parties. The Arbitration Board
                        shall comprise three members &ndash; one appointed by each party and the third member to be nominated by the two appointed members by mutual consent. Arbitration shall be held at Hyderabad, India. The proceedings of arbitration
                        shall be in the English language. The arbitrator&rsquo;s award shall be final and binding on the Parties. If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the courts
                        at Hyderabad.</p>
                    <p>If the dispute cannot be resolved by this two-step Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism, it shall be referred to the courts at Hyderabad.</p>
